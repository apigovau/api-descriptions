**This is a prototype only**

Go [here](https://abr.business.gov.au/Tools/WebServices) or the real version of the ABN lookup servcie.

# Getting started
The ABN Lookup web services allow you to integrate ABN Lookup validation and data into your own applications. There are many uses for the web services, including:

- ABN validation and pre-fill on forms
- Keeping ABN details stored in your database up-to-date

Access to the ABN Lookup web services is free of charge.

The web services provide a number of search options that are not available through the ABN Lookup website. For example, through the web services you can:

- Request a list of ABNs for a selected postcode with optional filters such as date updated, date registered, etc.
- Control how many matching names are returned by the name search.
- Create advanced name search queries to better control search results

**Important:** We recommend that you avoid use of [trading names](https://abr.business.gov.au/Help/Glossary#tradingname) as these have not been updated since 2012 and will be retired in 2018.

## Limitations

The following answers to common questions will help you to understand whether the ABN Lookup web services will meet your needs.

For more information refer to the [ABN Lookup web services schema (18 KB ZIP)](http://abn.business.gov.au/Downloads/AbnLookupSchema.zip).

## Business entity

**Important:** We recommend that you avoid use of [trading names](http://abn.business.gov.au/Help/Glossary#tradingname) as these have not been updated since 2012 and will be retired in 2018.

The _Search by ABN_ and _Search by ASIC_ methods return a Business entity. Below is a summary of the important rules associated with a Business entity.

- Broadly speaking, a Business entity is either an individual or a non-individual
- With the exception of the ABN and ABN status, all attributes are optional.
 - This is to handle suppressed ABN details.
 - The only information available on ABN Lookup for suppressed ABNs is the ABN, ABN status and GST and charity tax concession registrations
- There are 8 possible name types returned by the web services:
 - Legal Name â€“ individuals only
 - Same as [entity name](http://abn.business.gov.au/Help/Glossary#entityname) on the ABN details screens
 - Main Name â€“ non-individuals only
 - Same as [entity name](http://abn.business.gov.au/Help/Glossary#entityname) on the ABN details screens
 - Business Name â€“ introduced May 2012
 - Main Trading Name
 - **Important:** [trading names](http://abn.business.gov.au/Help/Glossary#tradingname) have not been updated since 2012 and will be retired in 2018
 - Other Trading Name
 - **Important:** [trading names](http://abn.business.gov.au/Help/Glossary#tradingname) have not been updated since 2012 and will be retired in 2018
 - DGR Name (Deductible Gift Recipient)
 - PBI Employer Name (Public Benevolent Institution)
 - AWEF Name (Approved Worker Entitlement Fund)
- In the case of an individual
 - There is either zero (if ABN details have been suppressed) or one current Legal Name
 - There is no limit to the number of historical Legal Names
 - An individual will never have a Main Name
 - All other name types are optional and there is no limit to the number they may have either currently or historically
- In the case of a non-individual
 - There is either zero (if ABN details have been suppressed) or one current Main Name
 - There is no limit to the number of historical Main Names
 - A non-individual will never have a legal name
 - All other name types are optional and there is no limit to the number they may have either currently or historically

A summary of the relationship between name types and individuals/non-individuals for current and historical information is shown below.

#### Name types for Individuals

| Name Type |Current| Historical|
|---|---|---|
|Legal name|0 or 1|0 - many|
|Main name|n/a|n/a|
|Business name|0 â€“ many|0 â€“ many|
|Main trading name|0 â€“ 1|0 â€“ many|
|Other trading name|0 â€“ many|0 â€“ many|
|DGR fund Name|0 - many|0 - many|
|PBIE Name|0 - many|0 - many|
|AWEFName|0 - many|0 - many|

#### Name types for Non-individuals

|Name Type|Current|Historical|
|---|---|---|
|Legal name|n/a|n/a|
|Main name|0 - 1|0 - many|
|Business name|0 - many|0 - many|
|Main trading name|0 â€“ 1|0 â€“ many|
|Other trading name|0 â€“ many|0 â€“ many|
|DGR fund Name|0 - many|0 - many|
|PBIE Name|0 - many|0 - many|
|AWEFName|0 - many|0 - many|

## Search results list

The *Search By Name* methods return zero or more matching names ordered by relevance. Each match is awarded a score based on how closely it matches the search criteria. The best results are achieved by entering as much of the name as you know. For more information see [Search tips](http://abn.business.gov.au/Help/SearchTips).

A matching record contains:

- ABN and status
- Matching name, current/historical indicator and match score
- State and postcode of the main business location

## ABN list

The _Search with Filters_ methods return zero or more ABNs. As only the ABN is returned through the _Search with Filters_ methods you will need to call the *Search by ABN* methods to retrieve the ABN details.

## ABN test cases

The following table of ABNs are useful test cases as they represent some of the more extreme examples in the database.

#### ABN test cases

|Description|ABN|
|---|---|
|Suppressed ABN|34 241 177 887|

# Sample code and resources

Incorporating the ABN Lookup web services into your application is usually quite straight forward.

To help you get started, see:

- [Schema (18 KB ZIP)](http://abn.business.gov.au/Downloads/AbnLookupSchema.zip) for a definition of the data returned by the web services. Note: The root document is **abrPublicPayloadSearchResults.xsd**.
- [Sample code](http://abn.business.gov.au/Tools/SampleCode) for a number of different languages and platforms including Visual Basic, C#, Java, php, Microsoft Access and Excel.

## Service description (WSDL)

The Web services Description Language (WSDL) is a language for describing web services and how to access them.

The ABN Lookup WSDL and test pages can be found at:

- [ABN Lookup web services](http://abr.business.gov.au/abrxmlsearch/abrxmlsearch.asmx)
- [ABN Lookup web services (RPC)](http://abr.business.gov.au/abrxmlsearchRPC/abrxmlsearch.asmx) for RPC style encoding

# Change control

The ABN Lookup web services allow you to incorporate ABN information and search capabilities into your own applications.

Over time, the information recorded about an ABN may change due to amendments to the underlying legislation. To ensure existing ABN Lookup web service users are not adversely affected, changes to the structure of the information returned may be implemented through new web service methods

For example, in July 2005 new legislation was introduced that effected the information recorded about tax concessions. We implemented new methods for searching by ABN and ACN which extended the information returned to include tax concession information where it existed. The schema was updated to reflect these changes without invalidating the information already being returned through existing web service methods. Likewise in September 2007 we implemented a new method which extended the information returned to include superannuation funds information where it exists. Then in May 2012 a new method was released that extended the information returned to include registered business names.

If you are integrating the web services for the first time or upgrading your existing applications, we recommend that you use the latest web service method (eg: [Search by ABN](Search by ABN), [Search by ASIC number](Search by ASIC number), [Search by Name](Search by Name), [Search with Filters](Search with Filters)) available.
