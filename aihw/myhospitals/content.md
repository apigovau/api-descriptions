The API currently allows you to search data across the MyHospitals national hospital reporting platform. This data provides information about your local hospital, hospitals within your region, state or territory and nationally.

You can see what information is available from the API, and how you can filter and search for specific information [here](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/myhospitals/content/api)
