The ABS Data REST API (Beta) allows you request detailed ABS statistics including economic, social and Census data.

Customise your query to return only the data and metadata you are interested in, in the format you want.

# Using the API

ABS Data API (Beta) offers two modes of operation:
-	Data retrieval, where users know the data they want to retrieve (eg. Unemployment rate, monthly trend estimate)
-	Data discovery, where, using a metadata-driven approach, users need to discover the data exposed by the web service.
